		<p class='lead'>Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or whirling, often described as dizziness, where a person or their surroundings appear to be moving when they are not. It's commonly caused by issues with the inner ear or brain, which are responsible for balance. Vertigo can range from mild and brief to severe and debilitating, and it can be associated with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and difficulty walking. </p>


		<h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
				Besides the spinning sensation, individuals may experience: Nausea, Vomiting, Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and Difficulties with balance and coordination. 
			</p>

			<p class='lead'>
				In simpler terms: Imagine you're on a merry-go-round, but you're not actually moving. That's essentially what vertigo feels like. It's a common condition with various potential causes, but often manageable with appropriate treatment.
