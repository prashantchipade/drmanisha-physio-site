		Postural correction involves achieving proper body alignment, while ergonomics is the science of designing your environment for comfort and efficiency, often to support good posture and prevent injury. 
		To improve your posture, become mindful of your alignment, strengthen your core and back muscles with targeted exercises, and stretch tight muscles like your hip flexors and hamstrings. 
		For ergonomics, adjust your workstation by ensuring your chair provides lumbar support and your monitor is at eye level, and remember to take regular breaks to move and stretch throughout the day.

		<h3>Benefits of good posture</h3>
		
		<p class='lead'><b>Pain Prevention</b>:Poor posture and improper workstation setup can lead to musculoskeletal imbalances, muscle fatigue, and chronic pain. </p>
		<p class='lead'><b>Injury Prevention</b>:Correcting posture and practicing ergonomics reduces the risk of developing injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis. </p>
		<p class='lead'><b>Improved Health</b>:Maintaining proper alignment strengthens your spine and supporting muscles, enhancing overall balance, stability, and well-being. </p>
		<p class='lead'><b>Increased Productivity</b>:		An ergonomic environment and good posture can boost efficiency and performance by reducing discomfort and strain. </p>
		
		
		
		
		<h3>What to do to maintain good posture ?</h3>
		<h4>Be Mindful</h4><p class='lead'>Regularly check and adjust your posture throughout the day, aligning your ears, shoulders, and hips.</p>
		<h4>Strengthen Your Core</h4><p class='lead'>Engage in exercises like planks and bridges to build a strong core that supports your spine.</p>
		<h4>Stretch Tight Muscles</h4><p class='lead'>Incorporate stretches for your hip flexors, hamstrings, and chest to release tension and improve alignment.</p>
		
		<h4>Ergonomics</h4>

			<p class='lead'><b>Chair</b>: Use a chair with lumbar support, ensuring your feet are flat on the floor and knees are level with your hips. </p>
			<p class='lead'><b>Monitor</b>: Position your computer screen at eye level to avoid bending your neck.  </p>
			<p class='lead'><b>Keyboard & Mouse</b>: Place these within easy reach to prevent strain on your wrists and shoulders.  </p>
		
		<h4>Movement Breaks</h4><p class='lead'>Take frequent short breaks to stand up, walk around, and stretch to improve circulation and prevent stiffness. </p>
