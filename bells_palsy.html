		<p class='lead'>Bell palsy is an unexplained episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis. 
		It begins suddenly and can get worse over 48 hours. This condition results from damage to the facial nerve (the 7th cranial nerve). Pain and discomfort usually occur on one side of the face or head.
		
		The exact cause is unknown. Bell's palsy may be a reaction to a viral infection resulting in inflammation. It rarely occurs more than once.
		Bell's palsy is characterised by muscle weakness that causes one half of the face to droop.
		Physiotherapy can help prevent muscles from permanently contracting. Supportive steroids and antivirals can also be prescribed in some cases.
