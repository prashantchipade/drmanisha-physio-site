		<p class='lead'>Why Does My Shoulder Hurt, and Could It Be Serious? Shoulder pain is a common symptom with many potential causes, including rotator cuff injuries, arthritis, bursitis, dislocations, and referred pain from the neck. Treatment for minor pain may include rest, ice or heat, over-the-counter pain relievers, and gentle movement. See a doctor for severe pain, persistent symptoms after few days, sudden pain, inability to move the arm, or signs of a dislocated or fractured bone.</p>

		<h3>Common Causes</h3>
		
		
			<p class='lead'><b>Rotator Cuff Problems</b>: Inflammation or tears in the tendons of the rotator cuff, the group of muscles that provide wide range of motion. <br>
			<b>Arthritis</b>: Degeneration of the cartilage in the shoulder joint.  <br>
			<b>Bursitis</b>: Inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs that cushion the joint, often occurring with rotator cuff issues.  <br>
			<b>Frozen Shoulder</b>: Stiffness in the shoulder joint that makes movement difficult and painful.  <br>
			<b>Shoulder Dislocation</b>: The shoulder joint coming out of its socket.  <br>
			<b>Fractures</b>: A broken bone in the shoulder or collarbone.  <br>
			<b>Impingement Syndrome</b>: Tendons and bursae becoming trapped in the space under the "roof" of the shoulder, causing inflammation and pain.  <br>
			<b>Referred Pain</b>: Pain that originates from another area, such as the neck or a spinal nerve problem, and is felt in the shoulder.

			<h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
			<h4>You should seek medical advice for shoulder pain if you experience: </h4>
			<p class='lead'>Sudden, severe pain.</br>
			Inability to move your arm.</br>
			A change in shape, significant swelling, or numbness in the arm or shoulder.</br>
			Pins and needles or burning sensations.</br>
			Pain that doesn't improve after two weeks of self-care.</br>
</p>
	  <h3>Home Care for Minor Shoulder Pain</h3>
	  
			<p class='lead'><b>Rest</b>: Avoid activities that worsen the pain.<br>
			<b>Ice</b>: Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes every few hours to reduce pain and swelling. <br>
			<b>Gentle Movement</b>: Stay active and gently move your shoulder to prevent it from becoming stiffer.  
			</p>	  

	  <h3>How to avoid Shoulder Pain</h3>
	  
			<p class='lead'>
			<b>Improve Posture</b>: Sit and stand with your shoulders back, chest open, and avoid slouching, especially if you have a desk job.<br>
			<b>Adjust Your Workspace</b>: Set up your computer and workstation to support an ergonomic and healthy posture. <br>
			<b>Take Breaks</b>: Move around and take breaks during repetitive tasks or long periods of sitting to reduce strain on your shoulders.  <br>
			<b>Avoid Overloading</b>: Don't carry heavy items that strain your shoulders, and try to distribute weight evenly rather than carrying bags on one shoulder.
