		<p class='lead'>Back and neck pain commonly stem from issues in the musculoskeletal system, like muscle strains from poor posture or overuse, and degenerative conditions such as arthritis or herniated discs. Other causes include injury, inactivity, and in rare cases, infections or tumors.</p>

		
		
		<h3>Common Causes</h3>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Muscle Strain & Overuse</b>: Repetitive motions, heavy lifting, or spending long hours in poor posture (like looking at screens) can strain muscles and ligaments supporting the spine.<br>
				<b>Aging</b>: Natural wear and tear can lead to degeneration of spinal joints, while the discs in the spine can weaken over time.<br>
				<b>Injury</b>: Accidents, such as whiplash from car crashes, can damage soft tissues, ligaments, discs, and joints. <br>
				<b>Poor Posture</b>: Hunching or holding your head forward for extended periods puts significant strain on the neck and spine.<br>
				<b>Stress</b>: Mental stress can cause people to tighten their neck and back muscles, leading to pain and stiffness.<br>
			</p>
		
		<h3>How to avoid  back & neck pain</h3>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Maintain Good Posture</b>: Keep your head centered over your spine, with your ears directly above your shoulders and your shoulders aligned with your hips.<br>
				<b>Working with Screens</b>: Hold phones and tablets at eye level to avoid bending your neck down. Adjust your computer monitor to be level with your nose. <br>
				<b>Ergonomic Setup</b>: Use a supportive chair with armrests, and ensure your computer monitor and keyboard are positioned to maintain proper posture. <br>
				<b>Maintain a Healthy Weight</b>: Extra weight, especially around the stomach, can strain your lower back.<br>
				<b>Stay Hydrated</b>: Drink plenty of water to help keep the connective tissues and spinal discs hydrated and cushioned<br>
				<b>Supportive Pillow</b>: Use a pillow that keeps your head and neck aligned with your body<br>
				<b>Avoid Stomach Sleeping</b>: Try to avoid sleeping on your stomach, as it can strain your back. <br>
				<b>Manage Stress</b>: Practice relaxation techniques like belly breathing, as emotional stress can lead to muscle tension. <br>
