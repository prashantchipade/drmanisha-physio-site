		<h2>Back and neck pain</h2>
		<p class='lead'>Back and neck pain commonly stem from issues in the musculoskeletal system, like muscle strains from poor posture or overuse, and degenerative conditions such as arthritis or herniated discs. Other causes include injury, inactivity, and in rare cases, infections or tumors.</p>

		<h3>Common Causes</h3>


		<h4>Muscle Strain & Overuse:</h4>
		<p class='lead'>Repetitive motions, heavy lifting, or spending long hours in poor posture (like looking at screens) can strain muscles and ligaments supporting the spine. </p>
	
		<h4>Aging:</h4>
		<p class='lead'>Natural wear and tear can lead to degeneration of spinal joints, while the discs in the spine can weaken over time.</p>
		
		<h4>Injury:</h4>
		<p class='lead'>Accidents, such as whiplash from car crashes, can damage soft tissues, ligaments, discs, and joints. </p>

		<h4>Poor Posture:</h4>
		<p class='lead'>Hunching or holding your head forward for extended periods puts significant strain on the neck and spine.</p>

		<h4>Stress:</h4>
		<p class='lead'>Mental stress can cause people to tighten their neck and back muscles, leading to pain and stiffness.</p>

	  <h3>Underlying Conditions</h3>
	  <p class='lead'>Sciatica, Spondylosis, Muscle Sprain</p>
