	  <p>"We are an elderly couple and have been visiting her clinic for last about 3 years as and when we have any problem. Besides being a very thorough and ethical professional, she is gifted with a very sharp observation and ability to listen very attentively. She encourages patients to share their problems the way the patients actually experience and combines their input with her own observation of the affected site to arrive at very accurate diagnosis. Often we ended up getting cured with less number of sessions than initially planned and she informs the patients very candidly when to stop taking sessions. On quite a few occasions, after diagnosing the problem, she only advised a few simple exercises to follow without charging anything for the time she spent on explaining the exercises. Our overall experience at the clinic has been most satisfactory. Would recommend to anyone needing good physiotherapy experience."</p>

	  <p>"Thank you so much for your wonderful treatment Manisha Mam.😊 Your therapy suits me the best, Whenever I come to you with an issue, I go back completely cured. Your diagnosis is always accurate, and your balance of being strict yet friendly makes me feel truly cared for. I also appreciate that you prefer minimal medicines and never suggest unnecessary therapy sittings. Thank you for your honest dedication towards your patients.❤️"</p>

	  <p>"I have been a patient of Dr. Manisha for the last eight years, and words truly fall short when I try to express my gratitude for her extraordinary healing abilities. Eight years ago, I visited her as a last hope after being diagnosed with frozen shoulder in both shoulders. I had been advised to undergo surgery and was barely able to move. But within just two weeks of treatment with Dr. Manisha, my shoulder mobility returned to normal and the constant, unbearable pain disappeared completely. Her hands truly feel magical. Recently, about four weeks ago, I was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy (Facial Paralysis). Once again, I turned to Dr. Manisha and underwent daily treatment under her care. After four weeks, something I feared may never happen actually did my right eye, which had completely stopped blinking, began showing positive movement. Day by day, the affected side of my face kept improving noticeably. Dr. Manisha is not just a doctor she is a healer in the truest sense. From my perspective she has magical hands with great power from God. Her expertise, dedication, and compassion have changed my life more than once. I am deeply grateful to her and would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking genuine care and remarkable recovery."</p>

Even the service we had at mam's clinic was so homely and stress-free. Mam all our family best wishes are always with you for All your wonderful practice."</p>

	  <p>"Best experience👍! I had visited here twice for knee pain and upper back pain. The diagnosis was absolutely accurate, and the treatment began with IFT/Ultrasound physiotherapy sessions as required. She also provided recovery exercises that worked really well. As a professional, she is extremely well-mannered, and her vast experience is clearly reflected in her treatment and the recovery progress of patients. I would highly recommend her—she is truly one of the best physiotherapists I know."</p>
