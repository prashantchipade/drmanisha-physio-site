		Post-surgery rehabilitation is a structured recovery plan involving therapeutic exercises, pain management, and education to restore strength, mobility, and overall function after a 
		surgical procedure. Led by healthcare professionals like physical and occupational therapists, rehabilitation helps patients regain muscle strength, improve flexibility, prevent complications, 
		and gradually return to daily activities, work, and sports safely.
