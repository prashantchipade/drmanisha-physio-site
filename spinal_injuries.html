		<p class='lead'>A spinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cordâ€”the bundle of nerves and nerve fibers that sends and receives signals from the brain. 
		The spinal cord extends from the lower part of the brain down through the lower back. Direct injury to the spinal cord itself or damage to the tissue and bones (vertebrae) that surround 
		the spinal cord can cause an injury. This damage can cause temporary or permanent changes in feeling, movement, strength, and body functions below the point where the injury happens.</p>


		<h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
			
			
				<ul>
				<li class='muted'>Numbness, tingling, or a loss of (or changes in) sensation in hands and feet</li>

				<li class='muted'>Pain or pressure in the head, neck, or back</li>
				<li class='muted'>Weakness in any part of the body</li>
				<li class='muted'>Unnatural or uncomfortable positions of the spine or head</li>
				<li class='muted'>Loss of bladder and bowel control</li>

		<h4>Types of Spinal Injuries:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
							
				<b>Cervical spine</b>: This section is in your neck. It goes from the bottom of your skull to about the same level as your shoulders.<br>
				<b>Thoracic spine</b>: This section stretches from your upper back to just below your navel (belly button).<br>
				<b>Lumbar spine</b>: This section is in your lower back. It extends about to the top of where your buttocks meet, but your spinal cord ends a couple of inches above that.<br>
				<b>Sacral spine</b>: This section is in your back. It contains nerve roots below your butt to your tailbone.			
			
			</p>
		
		<h4>Treatment and Management:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
			
				<b>Medications</b>: Medications like steroids reduce swelling and inflammation around your spinal cord.<br>
				<b>Physiotherapy</b>: Photobiomodulation is one of the promissing treatment option for healing the injury. This along with other modelities like traction  helps hold you in place to minimize movement around your SCI.<br>
				<b>Splints, braces, halos or other support devices</b>: Similar to traction, these keep the area around your SCI stable. But unlike traction, you can wear these and move around with them on.<br>
				<b>Surgery</b>: The main priority of surgery is to relieve pressure on your spinal cord. It can also repair damage related to surrounding injuries pressing on your spinal cord
