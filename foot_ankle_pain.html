		<p class='lead'>Ankle and foot pain can result from injuries, such as sprains, fractures, and stress fractures, or chronic conditions like arthritis, plantar fasciitis, 
		and tendonitis. Other causes include ill-fitting shoes, structural issues like flat feet, and nerve-related problems such as peripheral neuropathy or tarsal tunnel syndrome.</p>

		<h3>Common Causes</h3>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Injuries</b>: Sprains, strains, fractures, and stress fractures from sports or accidents are common. <br>
				<b>Arthritis</b>: Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can cause pain and stiffness in the ankle and foot. <br>
				<b>Tendonitis & Bursitis</b>: Inflammation of the tendons (like Achilles tendonitis) or bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) can cause pain. <br>
				<b>Plantar Fasciitis</b>: Inflammation of the tissue on the sole of the foot, often causing heel pain. <br>
				<b>Poorly Fitting Shoes</b>: High heels or tight shoes can lead to soreness, bunions, and other foot problems.<br>
				<b>Structural Issues</b>: Conditions like flat feet (fallen arches) or bone spurs can cause pain. <br>
				<b>Nerve Problems</b>: Peripheral neuropathy or tarsal tunnel syndrome can cause burning, tingling, or numbness. <br>
			</p>

		<h3>For minor pain or injuries:</h3>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Rest</b>: Avoid activities that put weight on the affected foot or ankle. <br>
				<b>Ice</b>: Apply an ice pack (wrapped in a towel) for 15–20 minutes every few hours to reduce swelling.  <br>
				<b>Compression</b>: Gently wrap the area with a bandage to provide support. <br>
				<b>Elevation</b>: Raise your ankle and foot to help reduce swelling. <br>
			</p>

		<h3>How to avoid Foot & Ankle Pain:</h3>

			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Choose the right shoes</b>: Select shoes that fit correctly and provide adequate arch support, cushioning, and space for your toes<br>
				<b>Control your weight</b>: Maintaining a healthy weight reduces the stress and pressure on your feet and ankles. <br>
				<b>Strengthen and stretch:</b>: Engage in regular exercises that strengthen the muscles in your feet and ankles and improve flexibility. Stretching the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia can help prevent conditions like plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis.<br>
