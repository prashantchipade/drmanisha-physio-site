	  <div class="faq-answer">
		The treatment plan is a blend of Laser and Electro therapy, designed to effectively alleviate pain and expedite recovery. Each individual’s condition necessitates a tailored treatment strategy. Factors such as age, type of injury, overall health, and the physical demands of your occupation all play a role in shaping the treatment plan for effective and long-term recovery. The duration of each therapy is carefully calibrated to deliver optimal doses for maximum healing. Each treatment plan is grounded in extensive experience dealing with various conditions and understanding how your body responds to each therapy.

	<div class="hero-card" >
	  <button class="faq-question">Q. Why is it crucial to consistently follow the doctor’s recommended sessions without any breaks?</button>
	  <div class="faq-answer">
The human body requires a specific duration for ideal recovery. The initial sessions are structured to alleviate pain and break the cycle of discomfort. The following sessions support the body’s healing process, speeding up recuperation and fostering complete recovery. If there are disruptions, the body might revert to its defensive mechanism, possibly leading you back into the cycle of pain. Hence, it is extremely important to stick to the sessions as prescribed by the doctor.

	  <button class="faq-question">Q. In the course of physiotherapy, will the treatment plan solely consist of exercises, or will it also include other forms of treatment or medication?</button>
	  <div class="faq-answer">
  Within the scope of physiotherapy, subsequent to a comprehensive problem assessment, recommendations may encompass either a regimen of exercises or the utilization of physical therapies.
Among the physical therapies available, we offer both electrotherapy and advanced photobiomodulation therapy. These modalities are designed to effectively address the underlying causes of issues such as muscle injuries, strains, and spasms. Following these therapy sessions, a customized exercise plan will be prescribed to mitigate the risk of recurrence and to foster enduring resolution of the concern.
We prioritize minimizing the use of medication whenever feasible, as it generally offers only transient relief.
