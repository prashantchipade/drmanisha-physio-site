	<div class="hero-card" >
	  <div style="background:#fff;color:var(--primary)">Q. Will my condition relapse after taking Class IV Laser treatment?</div>
	  <div>
		Laser therapy, especially Class IV, is a boon for physiotherapy as its light energy can penetrate more than 5 cm into the body to heal deep-seated injuries—an alternative that previously required surgery. Such injuries often result from factors like excess weight, nutritional deficiencies, poor lifestyle, or faulty ergonomics. However, unless these underlying issues are corrected after healing, there is a high risk of re-injury at the same site.<br>
		Physiotherapy sessions—whether Laser, Ultrasound, IFT, or any other modality—are designed to help you recover from injury and break the cycle of pain. It’s much like taking antibiotics for an infection: antibiotics help your body fight off the infection, but once the course is complete, it’s up to you to maintain hygiene, maintain healthy lifestyle to prevent reinfection.

	  <div style="background:#fff;color:var(--primary)">Q. What is meant by treatment plan ?</div>
	  <div>
		The treatment plan is a blend of Laser and Electro therapy, designed to effectively alleviate pain and expedite recovery. Each individual’s condition necessitates a tailored treatment strategy. Factors such as age, type of injury, overall health, and the physical demands of your occupation all play a role in shaping the treatment plan for effective and long-term recovery. The duration of each therapy is carefully calibrated to deliver optimal doses for maximum healing. Each treatment plan is grounded in extensive experience dealing with various conditions and understanding how your body responds to each therapy.

	<div class="hero-card" >
	  <div style="background:#fff;color:var(--primary)">Q. Why is it crucial to consistently follow the doctor’s recommended sessions without any breaks?</div>
	  <div>
The human body requires a specific duration for ideal recovery. The initial sessions are structured to alleviate pain and break the cycle of discomfort. The following sessions support the body’s healing process, speeding up recuperation and fostering complete recovery. If there are disruptions, the body might revert to its defensive mechanism, possibly leading you back into the cycle of pain. Hence, it is extremely important to stick to the sessions as prescribed by the doctor.

	<div class="hero-card" >
	  <div style="background:#fff;color:var(--primary)">Q. In the course of physiotherapy, will the treatment plan solely consist of exercises, or will it also include other forms of treatment or medication?</div>
	  <div>
  Within the scope of physiotherapy, subsequent to a comprehensive problem assessment, recommendations may encompass either a regimen of exercises or the utilization of physical therapies.
Among the physical therapies available, we offer both electrotherapy and advanced photobiomodulation therapy. These modalities are designed to effectively address the underlying causes of issues such as muscle injuries, strains, and spasms. Following these therapy sessions, a customized exercise plan will be prescribed to mitigate the risk of recurrence and to foster enduring resolution of the concern.
We prioritize minimizing the use of medication whenever feasible, as it generally offers only transient relief.

	  <div>
		 There are two very effective line of therapies –Laser therapy and Electro thereapy.<br>
		<b>Laser Therapy</b> – It is most advance treatment method. Class IV Laser Therapy is non-invasive use of laser energy to generate a Photochemical response in damaged or dysfunctional tissues. Laser Therapy can alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and accelerate recovery at a very fast pace.
		Class IV laser therapy stimulates and treats the root cause of pain, resulting in faster and long-lasting pain relief.<br>
		<b>Electro Therapy</b> – This is combination of IFT and Ultrasound therapy. This helps in reducing muscle spasm and reduction in pain
