		<p class='lead'>Joint and arthritic pain refers to the pain and stiffness in joints caused by different forms of arthritis, which are conditions that damage the joint's cartilage, 
		leading to bone-on-bone contact and inflammation. Symptoms include pain, swelling, loss of function, and morning stiffness that can range from minutes to hours. 
		Treatment often involves medications, physical therapy, lifestyle changes like exercise and weight management, and sometimes surgery.</p>



		<h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Pain</b>: Typically worse with activity and at the end of the day, though some forms of arthritis can cause pain at rest.<br>
				<b>Stiffness</b>: Particularly noticeable in the morning or after periods of rest. <br>
				<b>Swelling</b>: A sign of inflammation in the joint. <br>
				<b>Reduced Range of Motion</b>: Difficulty moving the joint. <br>
				<b>Other Symptoms</b>: Fatigue, weakness, and at times, issues with other organs like the skin or eyes<br>
			</p>
	
		<h4>Common Types of Arthritis:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Osteoarthritis</b>: The most common type, caused by wear-and-tear of joint cartilage over time.<br>
				<b>Rheumatoid arthritis</b>: An autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the joint lining, causing inflammation and potential joint destruction. <br>
				<b>Gout</b>: A form of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid in the body, leading to painful joint attacks, often in the big toe. <br>
				<b> Psoriatic arthritis</b>: Occurs in people with psoriasis and affects joints, often in the hands and feet. <br>
			</p>
		
		<h4>Treatment and Management:</h4>
			<p class='lead'>
				<b>Exercise</b>: Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or bicycling can strengthen surrounding muscles and improve joint stability<br>
				<b>Weight Management</b>: Losing weight can significantly reduce the stress on weight-bearing joints.<br>
				<b>At-Home Therapies</b>: Applying heat (heating pads, warm baths) can relax muscles, while ice can reduce pain and swelling. <br>
				<b>Physiotherapy</b>: Different modelities in physiotherapys can help in reducing pain by reducing swelling and muscle stiffness. <br>
